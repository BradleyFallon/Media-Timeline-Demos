      <!-- Notes about whether this library is recommended and why -->
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Google Charts is a good library for creating basic timelines.
          It is easy to use and is not bloated with features that you don't need.
          It does not have support for making markers as points, but you can use
          zero-length bars to achieve the same effect.
