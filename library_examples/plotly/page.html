        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This is not a complete/correct demo, I don't feel like it's worth further effort. Plotly is a bit over-complicated for this application. It is a good library for creating more complex timelines, but it is not as easy to use as Google Charts.
          It also is more difficult read the chart.
